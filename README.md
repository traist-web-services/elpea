Once upon a time, music came on pieces of plastic. An LP (Long Play) record was 12" wide and spun at 33⅓ revolutions per minute.

No 'shuffle', no 'skip', no 'repeat', no 'only play track 3'.

An 'album' used to be two sides of about 20 minutes each. It was difficult to listen to tracks in any order other than the one the artist intended, and listening to something different in every track was so much hassle as to not be worth it.

Pepperidge Farm remembers.

Times moved on, and now, Spotify shuffles artists and tracks, and recommends and suggests... and it's great. It's an incredible advancement in technology, but it came at a price.

The 'B' sides. The 'concept album', where all songs follow a theme, or an idea. Artistic freedom suffers because every track needs to be a radio friendly unit shifter.

Elpea wants to bring back the 'long play'. Make a cup of tea, pop a record on, and listen to every track on it.

It's even got a little crackle when you put a record on.
